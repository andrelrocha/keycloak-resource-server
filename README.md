## üíª About

GeekCatalog API is designed to manage media and art content not covered by other widely-used market applications like Letterboxd. It offers users the capability to manage various types of media such as series, anime, games, or any other implemented media types, through CRUD operations following the business requirements. The API provides endpoints following REST standards, as well as multimedia communication channels, enabling users to manage storage and media responses such as images in the database for frontend consumption.

The API is built using Spring Boot and incorporates Flyway and Hibernate for database management, adhering to best practices in communication with the database. It manages multiple schemas within a multi-application schema structure, accommodating a legacy application already developed by me in: [https://github.com/andrelrocha/backlog-app-API].
